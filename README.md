# Building a Robust Hosting Platform on Azure
I’ve had the exciting opportunity to architect and build a hosting platform on Azure, and now I want to take it a step further by refining the platform and sharing my journey with others in the tech community. Over the course of several blog posts, I’ll walk you through each phase of the project, from infrastructure design to deployment strategies. This series will provide a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to build a similar platform or understand the components involved.

## Part 1: [Azure Infrastructure Overview](./docs/Part_1.md)

In this first part, I’ll break down the Azure infrastructure we designed. We’ll dive into the architectural decisions, the resource group setup, networking components, and the security considerations that formed the backbone of our hosting platform. Whether you’re new to Azure or experienced, you’ll gain insights into best practices and key features that Azure offers for building resilient, scalable infrastructure.

## Part 2: [Terraform Script for Azure Infrastructure](./docs/Part_2.md)

Once the architecture is defined, the next step is to automate the deployment of this infrastructure. In this part, I’ll share the Terraform scripts we used to build the Azure infrastructure. We’ll go through the code, explaining how each resource is created and managed. You’ll learn how to use Terraform to ensure your infrastructure is consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled.

## Part 3: Configuration Management Post-Deployment

Deploying infrastructure is just the beginning. Configuration management is crucial to ensure your environment is secure, optimized, and aligned with your operational needs. In this section, I’ll cover the tools and techniques we used to manage configurations after the infrastructure was deployed. Topics will include automation scripts, security hardening, and environment-specific configurations.

## Part 4: Web Server and Database Setup

No hosting platform is complete without a solid web server and database setup. Here, we’ll discuss how we configured the web servers and databases to support the applications hosted on our platform. We’ll explore different configurations, performance optimizations, and security measures to ensure the environment is robust and scalable.

## Part 5: Building an Admin Portal

To streamline the management of our hosting platform, we built a custom portal for administrative tasks. This section will guide you through the process of developing an admin portal that integrates with your infrastructure. We’ll cover design considerations, technology choices, and the functionalities that make managing the platform easier and more efficient.

## Part 6: Application Deployment Strategy

One of the most critical aspects of any hosting platform is the deployment strategy for applications. In this part, I’ll share the deployment strategies we implemented, including CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and version management. You’ll learn how to deploy applications in a way that minimizes downtime, enhances reliability, and ensures a seamless user experience.

## Part 7: Monitoring and Logging

Finally, I’ll conclude the series by discussing monitoring and logging. These are essential for maintaining the health and performance of your platform. We’ll explore the tools and techniques we used to monitor the infrastructure, applications, and databases, as well as how we set up logging for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
